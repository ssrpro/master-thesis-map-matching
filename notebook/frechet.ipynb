    "Given the small, medium, and large graph dataset from the graph notebook we will create all the necessary data structures.\n",
    "We do this in two stages.\n",
    "First we create basic data structures, like the SSPD, neighboring vertex matrix and distance matrix.\n",
    "These data structures will be stored with the pickle module as stage 1 for small medium and large graphs.\n",
    "Then we create the more complicated data structures, which are the edge matching and the restricted Fréchet distance data structure.\n",
    "These data structures depend on the parameter $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n",
    "We will use the parameter values $1, 1/2, 1/4$ for the types $1, 2, 3$ respectively.\n",
    "This means that we have in total of 9 stage 2 data structures stored.\n",
    "Finally, we will use one of the 9 pre-computed data structures to perform map matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we commented sections of the code that does not need to be run.\n",
    "If the notebook has never been run before, make sure to comment-out the necessary graphs.\n",
    "For instance the medium dataset with $\\varepsilon = 1/2$ requires computing `highway_medium_stage1.dat` and `highway_small-2_stage2.dat`.\n",
    "Hence, make sure to leave the other code commented, and only comment-out the necessary code to speed up the computation.\n",
    "After computing the data structure, you can comment it again, since the result is stored as pickle objects in the run folder."
